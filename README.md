# Technical Writing Proposal: Kai Stevens

## Title
- Evolution of AI Tools for generating artwork

## Format
- Short youtube video overviewing the history of the machine learning tools used for generating output, and specifically generating images / artwork

- Hopefully featuing some other classmates for a short segment where I show them a series of generated / real images and ask if they can indentify what's real and what's fake

- Conclude by showing how far AI art generation has come

## Intended Audience
- Anyone who's interested in machine learning / AI, and how it can be used to generate artwork

## Experience
### What knowledge of the *topic* do I already have?
- I know Python and one of the biggest machine learning libraries that currently exists (TensorFlow and Keras)
- Knowledge of machine learning and specifically convolutional neural networks
- Experience using DCGANs for generating images
### What knowledge of the *topic* do I need to aquire?
- The most current techniques and tools used for generation tools like DALL-E
- https://openai.com/dall-e-2/
### What knowledge of the *format* do I already have?
- What youtube videos are and how to record them and upload them
- Basic video editting knowledge
### What knowledge of the *format* do I need to aquire?
- Could do with a bit more editting knowledge

## Content Outline
### Introduction:
- Introduce machine learning, neural networks and how it can be used for generating images
### History and evolution
- Brief overview of the tools and how they've evolved over time
### Guess the image type segment featuring a few classmates (hopefully :D)
- Ask some classmates to look at a selection of real and generated images, see if they can accurately guess if an image is real or fake
### Current state of AI generation
- What is the most up to date tools and how is it used
### Potential Issues
- Are there any ethical issues with the evolution of these tools and their power?
### Conclusion
- Wrap it all up, talking about the current state, how its got here, and where it goes from here
